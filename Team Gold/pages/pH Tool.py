**What is pH and why does it matter?**  
pH is a measure of how acidic or alkaline your water is, on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline).  
For drinking water, the ideal range is **6.5 to 8.5**.  
- Low pH can cause corrosion in pipes and may release metals into the water.  
- High pH can make water taste bitter or reduce disinfection effectiveness.  
Understanding your waterâ€™s pH helps ensure it's safe, healthy, and pleasant to use.
